## 📦 Project Overview

This project presents a **Feature Engineering case study** based on Delhivery's operational dataset. Delhivery, India’s leading supply chain services company, plays a critical role in last-mile delivery, warehousing, and logistics optimization. The goal is to refine raw data into meaningful features that can power deeper analysis or machine learning tasks.

---

## 🧠 Objective

- Perform detailed **data cleaning and transformation**
- Create insightful and usable **features from raw shipment data**
- Handle time, date, and delivery-related inconsistencies
- Extract logistics insights that can help in **predicting delivery outcomes**

---

## 🛠️ Core Feature Engineering Steps

- 🚚 **Delivery Date & Time Processing**  
  - Extracted delivery durations, day of week, and delivery hour from timestamps.
- 📊 **Categorical to Numerical Transformation**  
  - Encoded product categories and shipment modes.
- 🧮 **Derived Metrics**  
  - Created new columns like delay status, product type bucket, and delivery windows.
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning**  
  - Removed nulls and handled inconsistent types.
- 📦 **Target Feature Creation**  
  - Defined whether delivery was **on time or delayed**.

---

## 📈 Insights Gained

- Delivery time patterns vary significantly with **shipment mode** and **product type**.
- Certain categories consistently face **delivery delays**.
- Feature engineering enables segmentation that can guide **operational optimizations**.

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, datetime)
- Jupyter Notebook / Python script
- Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering techniques

---

## 🔗 Business Context: Why It Matters

Delhivery operates in a high-volume, high-speed logistics environment. Data-driven insights can enable:
- Predictive delivery systems
- Route optimization
- Better SLAs and customer satisfaction
